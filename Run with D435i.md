# Run with Intel RealSense D435i

Make sure camera parameters in `Examples/RGB-D/d345i.yaml` are correct. If you are not sure just run the following example, the program will query and show camera parameters at the beginning.

```bash
./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_realsense Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/d435i.yaml
```
